# Yelp-Photo-Classification

### Description:
Yelp.com and Yelp mobile App publishes crowd-sourced reviews about businesses. The Yelp Restaurant Classification Challenge (YRCC) is a challenge hosted by a data science community known as Kaggle in collaboration with Yelp. The goal of the YRCC is to build a model that automatically labels restaurants with multiple categories based on user-submitted photos. A restaurant can be associated with one or more of the following nine labels or attributes:
0 - good for lunch
1 - good for dinner
2 - takes reservations
3 - outdoor seating
4 - restaurant is expensive
5 - has alcohol
6 - has table service
7 - ambiance is classy
8 - good for kids
The Data consisted of 2000 restaurants with labeled train set and around 230,000 images. The unlabeled test set consisted of 10,000 restaurants with approximately 1.2 million images , with one or more of the labels applicable.
