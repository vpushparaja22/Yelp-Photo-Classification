# Yelp-Photo-Classification

### Description:
In this project, we are built a model that predicts labels for businesses using the images dataset submitted by the users on Yelp application. Each restaurant is going to be tagged with multiple labels by utilizing those images. The 9 labels to be tagged for each business is: good for lunch, good for dinner, takes reservation, outdoor seating, restaurant is expensive, has alcohol, has table service, ambience is classy, good for kids. Presently the labels are selected manually and it is optional as well. So therefore, there will be times when a user submitting a review might not select labels. And also, duplicate images need to be handled.
